Select Boxes
============
Small jQuery/CSS snippet for creating responsive custom select boxes. The
rendered html is fairly unstyled. Fork it, tweek it and style it the way
you want.

Html should be of the following form for the script to recognize it.

	<div class="select">
	  <select id="myId">
	    <option>Option 1</option>
	    <option>Option 2</option>
	    ...
	  </select>
	</div>
	
Happy hacking!!!
